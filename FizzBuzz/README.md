FizzBuzz.rb
==============

programmer: Amanda Kom (no collaboration)
--------------

- FizzBuzz first checks to see if there are any multiples of both 3 and 5, which will print "FizzBuzz"
- Next, it checks to see if the number is just a multiple of 3, which would print "Fizz"
- If it's not a multiple of 3, it will check if the number is a multiple of 5, which would print "Buzz"
- Finally, if the number is neither a multiple of 3 nor a multiple of 5, it will print out the input number
-Added changes from @Brookr
